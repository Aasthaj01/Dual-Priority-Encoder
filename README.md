# Dual-Priority-Encoder
Priority Encoder is a type of combinational circuit similar to a binary encoder, except that it generates an output code based on the highest prioritized input. In priority encoder, if two or more inputs are equal to 1 at the same time, the input having the highest priority will take precedence. In case of dual-priority encoder, the circuit identifies both the highest-priority and the second-highest-priority asserted signal among a set of input signals.
